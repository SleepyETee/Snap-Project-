# LA TV Shows Catalog

A dynamic, interactive catalog of TV shows set in Los Angeles built from the Snap Engineering Academy starter code. This project demonstrates my understanding of data structures (arrays and objects) and various data operations in vanilla JavaScript.

## Main Points

### Project Overview
- **Catalog Website:** Displays TV shows using dynamic cards generated from an array of objects.
- **Built With:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Data Structures
- **Array of Objects:** Each TV show is represented as an object with the following properties:
  - `id`
  - `name`
  - `category` (e.g., comedy, drama, reality, documentary)
  - `description`
  - `value` (release year)
  - `rarity` (network)
  - `rating`
  - `element` (lead actor/actress)
  - `bonusEffect` (tagline)
  - `imageURL`

### Data Operations
- **Filtering:** Users can filter shows by genre.
- **Searching:** Search across multiple fields (name, description, network, etc.).
- **Sorting:** Sort TV shows by name, release year, or rating (both ascending and descending).
- **Shuffling:** Randomize the order of the catalog.
- **CRUD Operations:** Add new shows, update existing ones, delete shows, and reset to default.

### Interface & UX
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Uses a hidden card template that is cloned and populated with TV show data.
- **Controls:** Includes dropdowns for filtering and sorting, an input for search, and buttons for shuffle, reset, and (if needed) grouping.
- **Visual Enhancements:** Responsive design with background animations and particle effects.

### Installation & Deployment
- **Clone and Use:** Start by cloning the template repository.
- **Local Edits:** Modify HTML/CSS/JS files as needed and preview via `index.html`.
- **Publish:** Deploy the final version using GitHub Pages or your preferred host.  
- **Submission:** Provide the live URL and GitHub repository link with your submission.

### Reflection
- **Learning Experience:** Gained proficiency with arrays, objects, and various data operations.
- **Challenges:** Implementing real-time UI updates and ensuring a polished design.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider adding advanced features such as pagination and enhanced error handling.
